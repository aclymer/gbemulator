TODO
	Bugs
		Fix sound bugs
			mostly affects channel 1, some sounds are wrong
			do high notes sound out of pitch? YES: interpolation needed
			fix the never ending noise bug (when daisy turns into bug)
		Fix time allocated to CPU and timer
		Fix memory access timings
		Fix DAA instruction
		Fix HALT instruction
			halts until and interrupt is received, even if they are disabled: they are just not serviced (i believe)
		Implement STOP instruction
		Initialise sound/graphics data properly!
	Rewrites
		the SDL_Delay() calling code is bad
	Implementation
		Sprite ordering 
		State save/load DONE (mostly)
		Pause: stops sound! DONE
		Nice scaling algorithms (hqx, etc)
		Debugger: bit instructions
		Simple disassembler:
		Gameboy Color support
		UI
		Joystick support
		internal GB and GBC rom support
		settings/config file
	Check behaviour on real hardware
		Sound 
			sweep/envelope function
		Display
			How LY=LCY coincidences are dealt with
